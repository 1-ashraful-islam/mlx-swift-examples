#  MNIST

This is a port of the MNIST model and training code from:

- https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/blob/main/mnist

It provides code to:

- download the test/train data
- provides the MNIST model (MLP)
- some functions to shuffle and batch the data

See [mnist-tool](../../Tools/mnist-tool) for an example of how to run this.  The training loop also lives there.
